# SensorHub_Arduino AirwayManagement
Arduino code for SensorHubs AirwayManagement

The end goal is to replace firmware for the entire system to C/C++ + FreeRTOS without any Arduino dependencies.

However, for testing of new hardware and referencing other materials it remains indispensable.

This folder contains examples / test sketches for IMU-based airway management control.
