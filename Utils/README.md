# SensorHub_Arduino Utils
Arduino code for SensorHubs Utils

The end goal is to replace firmware for the entire system to C/C++ + FreeRTOS without any Arduino dependencies.

However, for testing of new hardware and referencing other materials it remains indispensable.

This folder contains examples / test sketches for the other sketches (e.g. BlinkWithoutDelayLib, Wirescanners).
