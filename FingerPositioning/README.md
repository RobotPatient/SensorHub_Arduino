# SensorHub_Arduino FingerPositioning
Arduino code for SensorHubs FingerPositioning

The end goal is to replace firmware for the entire system to C/C++ + FreeRTOS without any Arduino dependencies.

However, for testing of new hardware and referencing other materials it remains indispensable.

This folder contains examples / test sketches for IR-sensor based finger position (sub category for chest compression) detection.
